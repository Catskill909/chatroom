# Mission Log: Make App Fit Browser (No Extra Space)

## Mission Statement
**Goal:** The ONLY objective is to make the live chat app fit perfectly in the browser viewport on all devices, with NO extra space at the bottom (especially on mobile). No other layout or style changes should be made.

## Current Production Issue
- In production, there is unwanted space at the bottom of the app on mobile browsers.
- If the user slides the interface, it temporarily fitsâ€”indicating a viewport height calculation issue.
- No issues with width, scrolling, or other layout areas.

## Attempts & Analysis
1. **Initial Approach:**
   - Changed `h-screen` to `h-dvh` in the main chatroom container.
   - Result: Added even more blank space at the bottom on mobile. This was a regression.
2. **Full Codebase Audit:**
   - Searched for and reviewed all CSS files (`App.css`, `index.css`).
   - Inspected Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.ts`).
   - Checked all React layout and wrapper files: `App.tsx`, `Index.tsx`, and confirmed the structure of `Chatroom.tsx`.
   - Searched for layout/container/wrapper components in `src/components` (none found except chatroom and children).
   - Searched for SCSS and other preprocessors (none found).
   - Confirmed there are no global or parent height/min-height/overflow rules affecting the chatroom.
   - Mapped out the DOM/layout structure for the chatroom and its parents to ensure no hidden containers are causing the issue.
3. **StackOverflow & Best Practices Review:**
   - Mobile browsers (especially iOS Safari) can miscalculate `100vh`/`dvh` due to address bar behavior.
   - Most robust solutions use a dynamic CSS variable for viewport height or a targeted mobile-only CSS rule.

## Next (Proposed) Minimal Fix
- Add a unique class to the chatroom root container (e.g., `oss-chatroom-viewport`).
- Add a mobile-only CSS rule for this class:
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    .oss-chatroom-viewport {
      height: 100vh !important;
    }
  }
  ```
- This targets ONLY the chatroom container and ONLY on mobile, with no changes to width or other layout.
- No JavaScript, no global style changes, no risk to other components.

## Why This Is Safe
- Scoped to a unique class, so it cannot affect any other part of the app.
- Only applies on mobile (where the bug exists).
- Easy to revert or adjust if needed.
