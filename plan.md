## üöÄ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features

#### Core Chat

  - Metadata extraction (artist, title, album)
  - Cover art display
  - Waveform visualization
  - Playback controls (play/pause, seek, volume)
  - Mobile-optimized touch controls
  - Live streaming support

- **Image Sharing**
  - Upload and display in chat
  - Automatic resizing (max 800px)
  - Click-to-enlarge with modal viewer
  - Support for GIFs and WebP

#### Technical Implementation
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- REST API for file uploads
- In-memory message storage
- File system storage for uploads
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Type-safe codebase with TypeScript

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Chatroom.tsx**: Main chat interface
- **ChatInput.tsx**: Message composition and media upload
- **ChatMessage.tsx**: Message rendering with media support
- **AudioPlayer.tsx**: Custom audio player component
- **LinkPreview.tsx**: URL preview component
- **UsernameModal.tsx**: User authentication
- **UsersList.tsx**: Online users display

### Backend (Node.js)
- WebSocket server for real-time communication
- REST endpoints for file uploads
- In-memory storage for active sessions
- File system for persistent storage
- CORS and security middleware

## üöß Future Enhancements

### Short-term
- [ ] Message reactions
- [ ] Typing indicators
- [ ] Message read receipts
- [ ] Message search functionality
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle

### Medium-term
- [ ] Video sharing support
- [ ] File sharing for documents
- [ ] End-to-end encryption
- [ ] Push notifications

   - Lazy loading of media

5. **Security**
   - User authentication
   - Message encryption
   - Rate limiting

## AI Implementation Mandate

**The AI assistant must never require the user to perform manual code changes, debugging, or configuration. All code, fixes, and debugging must be performed by the AI directly. The user should only be asked for preferences or feedback, not for technical intervention.**

- All changes must be reversible and thoroughly documented.
- If a production bug is found, roll back to the last working state before attempting further fixes.

## Lessons Learned / Next Steps

- Always verify production after any change; rollback if any breakage is detected.
- Document all critical failures and fixes in `critical-fix-needed.md`.
- Track ongoing production issues (e.g., audio upload bug) in dedicated files (see `live-audio-upload-errors.md`).
- Do not attempt risky, multi-file changes without a rollback plan.

## Future Development Ideas

### Next Up
