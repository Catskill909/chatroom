# Real-Time Chatroom Architecture Plan (With Audio & Image Upload)

## Objective
Create a robust, classic real-time chatroom where:
- All users see the same chat messages (including images and audio) and user list in real time.
- Users can upload and share audio and images in chat messages.
- Audio messages use direct file upload and Blob URLs (no base64 conversion).
- Avatars and chat window functionality work seamlessly with media sharing.
- All media is shared efficiently using direct upload (no base64 encoding for audio).

---

## Mandate: AI-Driven Implementation

**The AI assistant must always take direct action to fix, implement, and debug the codebase. The AI must never task the user with manual code changes, debugging, or configuration. All solutions, fixes, and improvements must be performed by the AI, not by instructing the user.**

- All changes must be safe, incremental, and thoroughly tested before deployment.
- Rollbacks to last known working states are preferred over risky experimental changes.
- Documentation must be kept up to date after any major fix or rollback.

---

## Success Criteria

- All chat, avatar, image, and audio upload features work in real time across browsers.
- Audio upload uses direct file upload and playback (no base64 conversion).
- The user is never tasked with manual code changes or debugging.
- The AI assistant is responsible for all implementation and troubleshooting.
- The codebase can be rolled back to a stable state at any time without data loss.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **User Authentication**
   - Username selection
   - Custom avatar upload and display
   - Real-time user list

2. **Messaging**
   - Real-time text chat
   - Message history on connection
   - User disconnection handling

3. **Media Handling**
   - Avatar upload and display using base64
   - Image sharing in chat messages
   - Audio upload and streaming playback with cover art and metadata (no base64 conversion)
   - Smooth audio player with progress bar and time tracking
   - Rich link previews for URLs with title, description, and thumbnail
   - Automatic image resizing (max 800px)
   - 10MB file size limit for audio, 5MB for images

4. **Error Handling**
   - Socket connection error handling
   - Image/audio processing error handling
   - Input validation

## Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Chatroom.tsx**: Main chat interface and message handling
- **ChatInput.tsx**: Message, image, and audio input controls
- **ChatMessage.tsx**: Individual message display (supports audio player and cover art)
- **UsernameModal.tsx**: User authentication and avatar upload
- **UsersList.tsx**: Online users display

### Emoji Picker Integration

- **Library:** Integrate [`emoji-mart`](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart) for emoji picker.
- **UI/UX:** Emoji icon in [`ChatInput.tsx`](src/components/ChatInput.tsx:1) opens a popover.
- **Interaction:** Emoji inserted at cursor position in chat input.
- **Implementation:** Uses shadcn-ui popover/dialog for accessibility and mobile compatibility.

### Backend (server.js)
- WebSocket server for real-time communication
- REST endpoints for audio/image upload
- In-memory storage for users and messages; uploads stored on disk
- Event-based communication

### Data Flow
1. Users connect and authenticate
2. Messages and images are sent as base64 strings
3. Server broadcasts to all connected clients
4. Frontend updates in real-time

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rich Media Support**
   - Support for video and file sharing
   - Inline previews for links and media

2. **User Experience**
   - Typing indicators
   - Message read receipts
   - Message reactions

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Private messaging
   - Message search
   - Message editing and deletion

4. **Performance**
   - Virtualized message list for large chat histories
   - Image compression before upload
   - Lazy loading of media

5. **Security**
   - User authentication
   - Message encryption
   - Rate limiting

## AI Implementation Mandate

**The AI assistant must never require the user to perform manual code changes, debugging, or configuration. All code, fixes, and debugging must be performed by the AI directly. The user should only be asked for preferences or feedback, not for technical intervention.**

- All changes must be reversible and thoroughly documented.
- If a production bug is found, roll back to the last working state before attempting further fixes.

## Lessons Learned / Next Steps

- Always verify production after any change; rollback if any breakage is detected.
- Document all critical failures and fixes in `critical-fix-needed.md`.
- Track ongoing production issues (e.g., audio upload bug) in dedicated files (see `live-audio-upload-errors.md`).
- Do not attempt risky, multi-file changes without a rollback plan.
